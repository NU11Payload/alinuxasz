Let's start by modifying the example Security Policy to fit the context of your website with account sign-ups.

# Security Policy

----
## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

For our website with account sign-ups, please report any security vulnerabilities to [report@security.alinuxa.com](mailto:report@security.alinuxa.com). We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 5 business days.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any potential impacts

You can expect regular updates on the status of your reported vulnerability. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and provide you with a timeline. If the vulnerability is declined, we will explain the reasons and consider it for future improvements.
